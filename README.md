# Blazor.CanvasDemo
Blazor WASM and Canvas Demo that will look at how Canvas rendering performs against an established enterprise use case.

This simple Blazor WebAssembly project uses BlazorExtensions/Canvas to render a detailed image, similar to those found in the production software used by my employer. As my business is looking to migrate fully towards Blazor, this project will explore one final hurdle in our adoption of it - Canvas performance vs. normal Javascript.
